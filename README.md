# WeatherApp

WeatherApp is an Android application built in Kotlin that emulates the weather app from Android 14.0. It provides comprehensive weather information for cities added by the user, fetched from freely available weather APIs. The app includes several features for adding and managing cities and viewing detailed weather forecasts.

## Features

- **Add Cities**: Users can add cities to their list in three ways:
  - **Search**: Use the city search feature to find and add a city.
  - **Popular Cities**: Select from a list of popular cities.
  - **Current Location**: Add the city based on the user's current location.
  
- **Manage Cities**: Users can remove cities from the list by selecting them.

- **City Weather Details**: On selecting a city, the following information is displayed:
  - **Current Temperature**: The present temperature in the city.
  - **Max and Min Temperatures**: The highest and lowest temperatures for the current day.
  - **Weather Description**: A short text description of the current weather conditions.
  - **24-Hour Forecast**: Weather forecast for the next 24 hours.
  - **7-Day Forecast**: Weather forecast for the next 7 days.
  - **15-Day Forecast**: Detailed weather forecast for the next 15 days, available via a dedicated button.

- **Additional Weather Information**: The app provides further details about the current weather, including:
  - UV index
  - Feels-like temperature
